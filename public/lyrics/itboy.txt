[Verse 1]
That's me, damn right
Baby went it boy, Jesus Christ
I bet on myself, I upped my price
I kiss and I tell, I ain't got no type
Two hundred K got me jumpin' on stage
All white Benz, see me whippin' mayonnaise
She lookin' at me, she wanna ta-ta-taste
Shorty got a boyfriend, get out my face
Ayy, bitch boy, I'm gon' smoke you like Endo
Free throw, never catch me in the friendzone
Cash real green, cheese pesto eatin' her box like bento
Um momento, tap keep bustin' like Pepsi Mentos

[Verse 2]
I'm that baby, Baby in the club lookin' for single ladies
Let's go shop and blow some cash, hop in my bubblegum Mercedes
She got curvature, I'm curvin' her
I'm flaky, please don't hate me
Tiffany from Perth, she nice, she thunder-fuck me, AC/DC
What the fuck is wrong with you?

I-T boy, the it boy, you know he the shit boy
I-T boy, the it boy (It boy), you know he the shit boy (Shit boy)
I-T boy, the it boy (It boy), bitch, I'm him
I-T boy, the it boy, that's me, that's right
